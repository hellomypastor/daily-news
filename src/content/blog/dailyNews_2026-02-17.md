This article discusses the intense work culture within San Francisco's AI startups, where employees often work 12-hour days, 6 days a week, with little to no work-life balance. Founders and employees describe the pressure to keep up with fast-evolving AI tools and to avoid being left behind in the industry. The article highlights concerns about AI replacing mid-level jobs and the anxiety it creates among workers, while also noting the broader implications for the tech industry and other sectors. It portrays the AI sector as a microcosm of the future of work, where innovation and uncertainty coexist, pushing individuals to adapt or risk obsolescence.

This article reflects on the growing anxiety in the software community due to the rapid adoption of AI tools and their impact on traditional coding practices. It discusses the psychological effects of panic attacks caused by the uncertainty of future-proofing one’s skills and the pressure to stay ahead of the curve. The author shares personal experiences with anxiety and outlines a practical approach to managing it, advocating for patience, a structured workflow, and the use of a funnel method that combines string matching, embeddings, and LLMs. The goal is to maintain calm amidst disruption while building a better future for the industry.

This article outlines a practical approach to deduplicating large datasets using a combination of string matching, embeddings, and LLMs. It explains how different methods like Levenshtein distance and Jaro-Winkler similarity can be used for fuzzy matching, while embeddings help detect semantic duplicates. The article also discusses techniques such as blocking and Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) clustering to manage computational costs. Finally, it emphasizes the role of LLMs in determining entity equivalence while highlighting the importance of structuring outputs and including reasoning fields for consistency and debugging. The suggestion is to use a funnel-like approach to optimize accuracy and efficiency.
